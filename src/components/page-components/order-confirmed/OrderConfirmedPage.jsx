      </p>
      <p className={styles.terms}>
        First - you didn't actually order any products and we didn't take any of
        your money (even though that would be a SWEET deal for us).
      </p>
      <p className={styles.terms}>
        Second - this app uses localStorage to track your purchase history so we
        can (in the future) use a personalization algorithm to recommend a
        product you're more likely to 'buy'.
